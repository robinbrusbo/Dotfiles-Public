Big thanks to muslim tech support Mr. Abdulhussein for fulfilling my wet dreams of having a juicy Arch linux setup AND making it easy to install again should my computer decide to say fuck you to me.

* To do
- Make script to toggle vsync on/off for browsing/gaming respectively
- Fix controller not working sometimes
- Make script to toggle polybar on/off on main screen (default: off)
- Autostart packages
